# transfer-learning-YAMNET
YAMNet is a pre-trained deep neural network that can predict audio events from 521 classes, such as laughter, barking, or a siren.

This repository contains a sequential implementation of YamNet.
- Use the model to classify new animal sounds and identify species using the [ESC-50 dataset](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50#repository-content)
- Deploy the model on mobile and embedded devices to create real-time animal sound classification applications
- Contribute to the dataset and improve the model's accuracy
